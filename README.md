## Project description
Today’s news consumption is marked by increasing tribalism.   newSmasher is 
an application that broadens the user’s perspective about news topics by exposing 
them to viewpoints outside of their go to news sources. the application randomly 
pulls news articles from a variety of sources around the world according to a topic 
that the user has inputted, exposing them to a wider variety of perspectives about 
that specific topic. These sources are not only from different publications but also 
from outlets in different parts of the world.  Users have the option to filter 
the article selection according to a specified date range.

## MVP
The MVP will select 5 randomized stories according to a single topic entry (input 
form) and list them in a feed, featuring headline, description, date, source and 
image pulled from the news API.  Upon clicking on a story, the user is presented with 
an full article view.

## Post MVP
Post MVP also allows user to select date range via a drop down menu and orders the 
stories in the feed in reverse chronological order.
